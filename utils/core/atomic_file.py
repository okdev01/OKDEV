"""Crash-safe file replacement.

Writing directly with ``open(path, "w")`` truncates the target first, so a crash, a full
disk or a locked file mid-write leaves an empty or partial file behind. These helpers write
to a sibling temporary file and swap it in with ``os.replace``, which is atomic on NTFS:
readers see either the old content or the new one, never a mix.

Kept free of project imports so ``config`` can use it without an import cycle.
